**between** üåç **Saudi Arabia and Jordan found home in south Africa**üè†

> #### üëÄ **`what really interest me?`**

After spending years of studying, teaching, troubleshooting, installing, connecting, backing up,
protecting, delivering, purchasing, supporting, integrating, manipulating, and taming software systems.

across a wide range of applications from networks to servers in hospitals, schools, offices, hotels and restaurants.
from infrastructure to application, taking down every challenge i faced.

it‚Äôs the time to start: building , creating , planning , designing ,testing , implementing , discussing , communicating , selling , developing , and enhancing software systems

having this spectrum of knowledge i could really make a good software engineer 
let this portfolio of projects prove me right.

>#### so the answer is : `full stack development`

**(why?)**

while enjoying reasoning and building algorithms and data structures i also want to present it in a nice UX
